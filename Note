If you don’t use helm package and have no .tgz files in the charts directory,
you can still use helmfile with unarchived Helm charts. Here's how it works:

Using Local Chart Directories
helmfile and helm can work directly with unarchived charts, as long as the chart directory structure is valid and
contains the necessary files (Chart.yaml, values.yaml, templates/, etc.).

Pros of Using Unarchived Charts:
 ----Easier Development:
You can directly edit the chart files without needing to repackage after every change.
 ----Version Control:
It's straightforward to keep the chart directory under version control.


Key Considerations:
Valid Chart Structure:

Ensure the local chart directory adheres to Helm's chart directory structure. It must include:
Chart.yaml: Metadata about the chart.
templates/: Kubernetes manifests and templates.
Optionally values.yaml for default values.
Dependencies:

If your chart has dependencies, ensure they are managed using helm dependency update to populate
the charts/ directory inside the chart folder.


 ---Why .tgz Files Are Optional
The .tgz packaged charts are primarily for:

Reproducibility: Distributing a static version of your chart.
Storage in Chart Repositories: Uploading to a chart repository like Helm Hub or an internal registry.
If you're working in a local environment or with a GitOps-style repository, unarchived charts are sufficient.
